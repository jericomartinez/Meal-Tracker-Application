# Calorie Tracker

## Keep track of your calories with ease

I will be creating a *food planner/calorie tracker app* which will help you reach your calorie goals. The app will include a daily calorie goal that a person sets and wants to achieve. To reach those goals, the app will propose a multitude of different meals providing the amount of calories and macronutrients in each dish. The user can either choose one of the suggested meals if they decided to cook and eat it or, they will input their own meal with the name of the food and the amount of calories it was. At the end of the day, the app will sum the calories consumed  and give you your daily calorie consumption for the day. 

The people who will use this app are those who would like to keep track of their calorie intake in order to achieve body goals such as gaining or losing weight. This project is of interest to me because I enjoy going to the gym and working out. Unknown to some, eating is just as important as working out for getting bigger and stronger. As such, this project implements my personal interests of fitness and health along with the design processes we learn in class.
